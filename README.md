This repository showcases my journey in software development and 3D printing. This project is not just a display of my
work; it's a platform where I enjoy teaching and sharing the knowledge and creations I've accumulated over time.

It's developed using technologies like Vitepress, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, SCSS, Storybook and Chromatic.

**Your contributions are welcome!** This is a personal repository, but I'm open to contributions that fix errors or
grammatical corrections. Let's collaborate to make this project even better.
